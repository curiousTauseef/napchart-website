# Favicon folder

This whole folder consists of `logo.png`, `faviconDescription.json` and a bunch of *generated files*

Generate the favicons this way

First install `real-favicon` (didn't include it in `package.json` because you never need to update)

```
npm i -g real-favicon
```

Build:

```
npm run build-favicons
```

Check for updates:

```
npm run update-favicons
```


+ move favicon to public folder manually
